####  Crypto Event Planning


Cryptocurrency is a virtual currency that you can‚Äôt double-spend or counterfeit because it has cryptography security. This form of currency is not distributed by agencies or governments, making them immune to manipulation. Rather than going through a third party, such as a bank, cryptocurrency allows two parties to complete a safe, legitimate transfer of funds using blockchains.

Purposeüî≠
   Blockchains are public transaction databases to track the spending and receiving of cryptocurrency. Blockchains group information together and, once filled, they close by linking to the previous block. This technology makes transferring funds secure and eliminates the ability to double-spend or counterfeit what it‚Äôs in your wallet. Cryptocurrency requires blockchains, while blockchains have value without cryptocurrency.
